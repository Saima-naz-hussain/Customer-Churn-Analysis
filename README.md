This GitHub repository provides insights from a recent churn analysis conducted for a telecom company. The churn rate stands at 16.84%, with retained customers showing a significantly higher average month tenure of 11.05 compared to churned customers' 3.09. Surprisingly, churned customers report a higher satisfaction score (3.39) than retained customers (3.00), prompting further investigation into churn despite satisfaction. Analysis reveals that customers with higher order frequency are less likely to churn, while payment mode significantly influences churn rates, with Cash on Delivery (COD) showing the highest churn rate at 25%. Recommendations include gathering feedback, segmenting customers, exploring external factors, encouraging repeat purchases, promoting digital payments, and continuous monitoring for effective churn management.
